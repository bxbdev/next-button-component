## Overview

### [Demo](https://next-button-component-phi.vercel.app/)

My name is Fiona Ye. I am a web designer, UIUX designer and product designer for many years. I love everything related to web development on the internet. I took this challenge to build a reusable component with theme which build once, less to touch coding and change the style if want to apply a new theme. Basically, modify theems and easy to apply to the page.

I've been worked many products in the different companies or startups, but I never made a theme viewer like this.

I know how to make the custom UI component and change the style, but hard to work with a dynamic component as I most used to work with static website to implement.

I made a prove of myself that I can build a component with theme changes.

it needs more foucs on the different styled components and defined the colors for each different element, and did less coding with maintain after produced as a product.

I practiced a lots with TypeScript, even I just started it in 2023.5.

TypeScript helps me to understand each props need to define type and reduce bugs reports, there are many interesting things with TypeScript that I need more time to explore with it to reach a gloal for more experience.
